## Introduction

Ecology is the scientific study of interactions between organisms and their environment. This chapter explores how living organisms interact with each other and with their physical surroundings, from individual populations to entire ecosystems. Understanding ecology is essential for addressing pressing environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable resource management. Ecology connects the biological principles from previous chapters to the larger scale of populations, communities, and ecosystems, showing how energy and information flow through living systems at planetary scales.
