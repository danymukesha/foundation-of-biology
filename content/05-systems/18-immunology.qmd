## Introduction

The immune system is the body's defense network against pathogens, cancer cells, and other threats. This remarkable system can distinguish self from non-self, remember past infections, and mount targeted responses while maintaining tolerance to the body's own tissues. Understanding immunology is essential for combating infectious diseases, developing vaccines, treating autoimmune disorders, and advancing cancer therapies. This chapter explores how the immune system protects us while maintaining the delicate balance required for health.

## Case Study: HIV/AIDS

**Background**: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) by destroying CD4+ T cells. Since its discovery in the 1980s, HIV has caused over 35 million deaths but is now manageable with antiretroviral therapy.

**Data for analysis**:

- **Transmission**: Sexual contact, blood, mother-to-child
- **Progression**: Acute infection → clinical latency → AIDS (without treatment)
- **Treatment**: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses viral load
- **Prevention**: PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), condoms
- **Epidemiology**: ~38 million people living with HIV worldwide (2021)
