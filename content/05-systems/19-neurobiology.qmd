## Introduction

The nervous system is the biological information processing network that allows organisms to sense their environment, integrate signals, and generate adaptive responses. From simple nerve nets to complex brains, nervous systems embody the principles of information flow in biology. This chapter explores how specialized cells called neurons use electrical and chemical signals to communicate, how neural circuits process information, and how these processes give rise to behavior, learning, and consciousness. Understanding neurobiology bridges cellular mechanisms with organismal behavior and cognitive function.

## Cellular Components of Nervous Systems

### Neurons: The Signaling Units

**Basic structure**:

- **Cell body (soma)**: Contains nucleus and organelles
- **Dendrites**: Receive signals (input zone)
- **Axon**: Conducts signals (conducting zone)
- **Axon terminals**: Transmit signals (output zone)
- **Synapse**: Junction between neurons

**Functional classification**:

- **Sensory (afferent)**: Carry information toward CNS
- **Motor (efferent)**: Carry commands away from CNS
- **Interneurons**: Connect neurons within CNS (90% of neurons)

**Structural classification**:

- **Multipolar**: Multiple dendrites, one axon (most common)
- **Bipolar**: One dendrite, one axon (sensory systems)
- **Unipolar (pseudounipolar)**: Single process that divides (sensory neurons)

### Glial Cells: The Support Cells

**Central nervous system glia**:

- **Astrocytes**: Support, regulate extracellular environment, form blood-brain barrier
- **Oligodendrocytes**: Form myelin sheaths (insulation)
- **Microglia**: Immune surveillance and phagocytosis
- **Ependymal cells**: Line ventricles, produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

**Peripheral nervous system glia**:

- **Schwann cells**: Form myelin sheaths
- **Satellite cells**: Support cell bodies in ganglia

### Myelination and Signal Conduction

**Myelin**: Lipid-rich wrapping that insulates axons

- **Nodes of Ranvier**: Gaps between myelin segments
- **Saltatory conduction**: Action potentials "jump" between nodes (faster)

**Conduction velocity factors**:

- **Axon diameter**: Larger = faster
- **Myelination**: Myelinated = faster
- **Temperature**: Warmer = faster (within physiological range)

## Electrical Properties of Neurons

### Resting Membrane Potential

**Definition**: Electrical charge difference across membrane (~-70 mV)

**Ionic basis**:

- **Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase**: Pumps 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in (establishes gradients)
- **Potassium leak channels**: Allow K⁺ to diffuse out (main determinant)
- **Sodium leak channels**: Allow some Na⁺ to diffuse in

**Nernst equation**: Calculates equilibrium potential for single ion

- $E_{ion} = \frac{RT}{zF} \ln \frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}}$

**Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation**: Calculates membrane potential considering multiple ions

### Graded Potentials

**Characteristics**:

- **Variable magnitude**: Proportional to stimulus strength
- **Decremental**: Decrease with distance
- **Local**: Don't travel far
- **Summation**: Can add together (temporal and spatial)

**Types**: Receptor potentials, synaptic potentials, pacemaker potentials

### Action Potentials

**Definition**: All-or-none electrical signal that travels along axon

**Threshold**: ~-55 mV (must be reached to trigger)

**Phases**:

1. **Resting state**: All voltage-gated channels closed
2. **Depolarization**: Na⁺ channels open → Na⁺ influx
3. **Peak**: Na⁺ channels inactivate, K⁺ channels open
4. **Repolarization**: K⁺ efflux
5. **Hyperpolarization (afterpotential)**: K⁺ channels close slowly
6. **Refractory periods**:
   - **Absolute**: Cannot fire another AP (Na⁺ channels inactivated)
   - **Relative**: Harder to fire (membrane hyperpolarized)

**Voltage-gated ion channels**:

- **Na⁺ channels**: Fast activation and inactivation
- **K⁺ channels**: Slower activation, no inactivation
- **Ca²⁺ channels**: Important at synapses

**Propagation**: Local currents depolarize adjacent membrane

## Synaptic Transmission

### Types of Synapses

**Electrical synapses**:

- **Gap junctions**: Direct cytoplasmic connection
- **Fast, bidirectional**
- **Synchronize activity** (cardiac muscle, some neurons)

**Chemical synapses**:

- **Synaptic cleft**: ~20-40 nm gap
- **Unidirectional**
- **Amplification, modulation possible**

### Chemical Synaptic Transmission

**Steps**:

1. **AP arrives** at presynaptic terminal
2. **Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open**
3. **Ca²⁺ influx** triggers vesicle fusion
4. **Neurotransmitter release** by exocytosis
5. **Diffusion** across cleft
6. **Binding** to postsynaptic receptors
7. **Postsynaptic response** (EPSP or IPSP)
8. **Termination** (reuptake, degradation, diffusion)

### Neurotransmitters

**Small molecule neurotransmitters**:

- **Acetylcholine (ACh)**: Neuromuscular junction, autonomic NS, CNS
- **Biogenic amines**: Dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, histamine
- **Amino acids**: Glutamate (excitatory), GABA (inhibitory), glycine (inhibitory)

**Neuropeptides**: Endorphins, substance P, oxytocin (modulatory)

**Gases**: Nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) (retrograde signals)

### Postsynaptic Potentials

**Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)**: Depolarization (makes AP more likely)

**Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)**: Hyperpolarization (makes AP less likely)

**Receptor types**:

- **Ionotropic**: Ligand-gated ion channels (fast, ~1 ms)
- **Metabotropic**: G-protein coupled receptors (slow, seconds to minutes)

**Integration**: Spatial and temporal summation determines if threshold reached

## Quantitative Problems

1. **Resting Potential Calculation**:
   Given: [K⁺]in = 150 mM, [K⁺]out = 5 mM, [Na⁺]in = 15 mM, [Na⁺]out = 150 mM, [Cl⁻]in = 10 mM, [Cl⁻]out = 125 mM
   Relative permeabilities: PK:PNa:PCl = 1:0.05:0.5
   Temperature = 37°C
   a) Calculate the Nernst potential for each ion.
   b) Use the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation to calculate the resting membrane potential.

2. **Synaptic Integration**:
   A neuron receives three synaptic inputs:
   - Input A: EPSP of 5 mV (10 ms duration)
   - Input B: EPSP of 8 mV (15 ms after A starts)
   - Input C: IPSP of 4 mV (5 ms after B starts)
   The neuron's resting potential is -65 mV, threshold is -55 mV.
   a) Plot the membrane potential over time.
   b) Does the neuron reach threshold? Why or why not?
   c) What would happen if Input C occurred 25 ms after A instead?

3. **Action Potential Propagation**:
   An unmyelinated axon has a conduction velocity of 1 m/s.
   A myelinated axon of the same diameter conducts at 50 m/s.
   a) How long does it take for a signal to travel 1 meter in each axon?
   b) If a reflex requires signals to travel 0.5 m to spinal cord and back, what's the minimum total time for each axon type?
   c) Multiple sclerosis demyelinates axons, reducing conduction velocity to 10% of normal. How would this affect the reflex time?

## Case Study: Phantom Limb Sensations

**Background**: After amputation, many patients experience sensations (including pain) in the missing limb. This phenomenon reveals important principles of neural organization and plasticity.

**Questions**:

1. How does the somatosensory cortex normally represent different body parts?
2. What neural changes might explain phantom limb sensations?
3. How has mirror therapy been used to treat phantom limb pain?
4. What does this case reveal about the relationship between neural maps and subjective experience?
5. How might this knowledge inform rehabilitation after nerve damage or spinal cord injury?

**Data for analysis**:

- **Cortical reorganization**: Adjacent areas expand into territory of missing limb
- **Mirror neurons**: Fire when performing or observing actions
- **Treatment efficacy**: Mirror therapy reduces pain in ~60% of patients
- **fMRI studies**: Show changes in cortical activation patterns
