## Introduction

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within biological systems: DNA → RNA → protein. This chapter explores how cells implement this information flow, examining the molecular mechanisms that ensure accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next and its expression within each cell. We will investigate how the abstract concept of biological information, introduced in Chapter 3, manifests in concrete molecular processes that underlie all cellular functions.

## The Central Dogma: Overview

### Historical Development

**Francis Crick (1958)**: First articulated the central dogma\
**Original formulation**: Information flows from nucleic acids to proteins, not reverse\
**Modern understanding**: DNA → RNA → protein, with important exceptions

### Information Flow Pathways

**General transfers** (occur in all cells):

1. DNA → DNA (replication)
2. DNA → RNA (transcription)
3. RNA → protein (translation)

**Special transfers** (occur in specific cases):

1. RNA → RNA (replication in RNA viruses)
2. RNA → DNA (reverse transcription in retroviruses)

**Never observed**:

1. Protein → protein
2. Protein → DNA
3. Protein → RNA

### Exceptions and Modifications

**Prions**: Protein → protein conformational change\
**Epigenetic inheritance**: Information transmitted without DNA sequence change\
**RNA editing**: Post-transcriptional alteration of RNA sequences\
**Alternative splicing**: Multiple proteins from single gene
