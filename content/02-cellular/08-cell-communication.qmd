## Introduction

Cells do not exist in isolation; they constantly communicate with each other and respond to environmental cues. Cell signaling allows cells to coordinate their activities, respond to changes, and maintain homeostasis. This chapter explores how cells send, receive, and interpret signals, transforming external information into intracellular responses. We will examine how signaling pathways implement the information processing principles introduced in Chapter 3, enabling cells to make decisions, adapt to conditions, and coordinate with neighboring cells in multicellular organisms.
