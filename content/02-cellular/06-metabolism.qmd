## Introduction

Metabolism represents the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within a cell or organism. These reactions transform energy and matter, enabling cells to grow, reproduce, maintain structure, and respond to their environment. This chapter explores how cells harness energy from their surroundings, convert it into usable forms, and utilize it to drive essential cellular processes. We will examine the intricate pathways that constitute cellular metabolism, focusing on how they implement the thermodynamic principles established in Chapter 2.

## Overview of Metabolism

### Defining Metabolism

**Metabolism**: The totality of an organism's chemical reactions
- **Catabolism**: Breakdown of complex molecules to simpler ones, releasing energy
- **Anabolism**: Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy

### Metabolic Pathways

**Linear pathways**: Series of reactions converting substrate to product through intermediates
**Cyclic pathways**: Starting molecule regenerated at end of cycle
**Branching pathways**: Multiple products from common intermediates

### Energy Coupling in Metabolism

**Exergonic reactions**: Release free energy (ΔG < 0)
**Endergonic reactions**: Require free energy input (ΔG > 0)
**Energy coupling**: Using energy from exergonic reactions to drive endergonic reactions

**ATP as energy currency**:
```
ATP + H₂O → ADP + Pᵢ + Energy (ΔG ≈ -30.5 kJ/mol)
Energy + ADP + Pᵢ → ATP (ΔG ≈ +30.5 kJ/mol)
```

### Metabolic Integration

**Intermediates**: Molecules participating in multiple pathways
**Amphibolic pathways**: Function in both catabolism and anabolism

## Enzymes: Biological Catalysts

### Enzyme Structure and Function

**Enzymes**: Protein catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions\
- **Active site**: Region where substrate binds and catalysis occurs
- **Substrate specificity**: Determined by active site geometry and chemical properties
- **Induced fit**: Conformational change upon substrate binding

### Enzyme Kinetics

**Michaelis-Menten kinetics**:\
- V₀ = (Vₘₐₓ × [S])/(Kₘ + [S])
- Vₘₐₓ: Maximum reaction velocity
- Kₘ: Substrate concentration at half Vₘₐₓ (measure of affinity)

**Factors affecting enzyme activity**:\
1. **Temperature**: Optimal range, denaturation at high temperatures
2. **pH**: Optimal for each enzyme, affects ionization states
3. **Substrate concentration**: Saturation kinetics
4. **Enzyme concentration**: Proportional to rate (at saturating substrate)
5. **Inhibitors**: Competitive, noncompetitive, allosteric
