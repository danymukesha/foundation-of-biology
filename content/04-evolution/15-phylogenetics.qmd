## Introduction

Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among organisms. By reconstructing the branching patterns of evolution, we can understand how different species are related, trace the history of traits, and make predictions about unknown characteristics. This chapter explores how biologists build and use phylogenetic trees—the family trees of life. Understanding phylogenetics is essential for making sense of biological diversity, studying evolutionary processes, and applying evolutionary knowledge to practical problems from disease tracking to conservation planning.

## Introduction to Phylogenetics

### What is a Phylogeny?

- **Phylogeny**: Evolutionary history of a group of organisms
- **Phylogenetic tree**: Diagram representing evolutionary relationships
- **Cladogram**: Tree showing branching order but not evolutionary rates
- **Phylogram**: Tree with branch lengths proportional to evolutionary change
- **Chronogram**: Tree with branch lengths proportional to time

### Historical Background

- **Pre-Darwin**: Natural systems of classification (Linnaeus)
- **Post-Darwin**: Evolutionary classification (Haeckel's trees) 
- **Modern era**: Computational methods, molecular data

### Why Study Phylogenetics?

1. **Understand evolutionary relationships**
2. **Classify organisms** (systematics)
3. **Study evolutionary processes**
4. **Trace origin and spread of diseases**
5. **Conservation priorities**
6. **Discover new drugs** (bioprospecting)
7. **Study coevolution**

## Tree Terminology and Interpretation

### Tree Components

**Nodes**: Branch points

- **Internal nodes**: Common ancestors
- **Terminal nodes (tips)**: Extant taxa

**Branches**: Lineages between nodes

**Root**: Common ancestor of all taxa in tree

**Clade (monophyletic group)**: Ancestor and all descendants

**Outgroup**: Taxon outside group of interest (rooting reference)

### Reading Trees

**Key points**:

1. **Tips can be rotated** around nodes without changing relationships
2. **Only branching order matters**, not left-right order
3. **Trees show relative relationships**, not absolute time (unless scaled)
4. **Extinct taxa** can be included as tips or internal nodes

**Common misconceptions**:

- "Lower" vs. "higher" organisms
- Linear progression
- "Primitive" vs. "advanced"

### Types of Groups

**Monophyletic (clade)**: Common ancestor + all descendants

**Paraphyletic**: Common ancestor + some descendants

**Polyphyletic**: Members from different ancestors

**Examples**:

- **Monophyletic**: Mammals, birds
- **Paraphyletic**: Reptiles (without birds), fish
- **Polyphyletic**: "Warm-blooded animals" (birds + mammals)

## Character Data for Phylogenetics

### Morphological Characters

**Traditional approach**: Before molecular methods

**Advantages**:

- Can study fossils
- Functional information
- Often cheaper

**Disadvantages**:

- Subjectivity
- Homoplasy (convergent evolution)
- Limited number of characters

**Scoring**: Discrete (presence/absence) or continuous

### Molecular Characters

**Revolutionized phylogenetics** since 1960s

**DNA sequences**:

- **Nuclear**: Single-copy genes, multi-copy genes
- **Organellar**: Mitochondrial, chloroplast
- **Ribosomal RNA**: Highly conserved, useful for deep divergences

**Protein sequences**: Amino acid alignments

**Molecular markers**: RFLPs, microsatellites, SNPs

**Choice of gene** depends on:

- **Evolutionary rate**: Fast for recent divergences, slow for deep
- **Function**: Housekeeping vs. specialized
- **Size**: Enough informative sites

### Character Evolution

**Homology**: Similarity due to common ancestry

- **Orthology**: Genes diverged after speciation
- **Paralogy**: Genes diverged after duplication

**Homoplasy**: Similarity not due to common ancestry

- **Convergence**: Independent evolution of similar traits
- **Reversal**: Return to ancestral state

**Synapomorphy**: Shared derived character (evidence for clade)

**Symplesiomorphy**: Shared ancestral character (not informative for grouping)

## Tree-Building Methods

### Distance Methods

**Principle**: Convert sequence data to distance matrix, build tree

**Neighbor-Joining (NJ)**:

- Fast, works well with many taxa
- Produces unrooted tree
- Example: Used in early molecular phylogenetics

**UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)**:

- Assumes constant evolutionary rate (molecular clock)
- Produces rooted tree
- Less used now due to clock assumption

### Character-Based Methods

**Maximum Parsimony (MP)**:

- **Principle**: Minimize number of evolutionary changes
- **Advantages**: Intuitive, no model assumptions
- **Disadvantages**: Long-branch attraction problem
- **Searches**: Exhaustive, branch-and-bound, heuristic

**Maximum Likelihood (ML)**:

- **Principle**: Find tree that maximizes probability of observed data given evolutionary model
- **Advantages**: Statistical framework, model-based
- **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive
- **Models**: Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter, more complex

**Bayesian Inference**:

- **Principle**: Find tree with highest posterior probability
- **Advantages**: Provides confidence measures (posterior probabilities)
- **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive, priors influence results
- **Software**: MrBayes, BEAST

### Choosing a Method

**Consider**:

- **Data type**: Morphological vs. molecular
- **Number of taxa**: Some methods scale poorly
- **Evolutionary model**: Violations affect some methods more
- **Computational resources**
- **Goals of study**

**Best practice**: Use multiple methods, compare results

## \Assessing Phylogenetic Trees

### Support Measures

**Bootstrap** (Felsenstein, 1985):

- **Method**: Resample data with replacement, build many trees
- **Interpretation**: % of trees containing clade
- **Thresholds**: >70% moderate, >95% strong support

**Jackknife**: Similar but resamples without replacement

**Posterior probability** (Bayesian): Probability clade is true

**Decay index** (Bremer support): How many steps until clade collapses

### Tree Comparisons

**Robustness**: Similar results from different methods/data

**Congruence**: Agreement between different genes/traits

**Conflict**: May indicate different evolutionary histories (e.g., hybridization, horizontal gene transfer)

### Sources of Error

**Long-branch attraction**: Fast-evolving lineages grouped artificially

**Inadequate sampling**: Missing taxa, characters

**Model misspecification**: Wrong evolutionary model

**Homoplasy**: Convergent evolution misleads

---

## Molecular Clock and Dating

### Concept

**Molecular clock hypothesis**: Rate of molecular evolution relatively constant over time

**First proposed**: Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1962)

**Evidence**: Roughly linear relationship between genetic divergence and time

### Calibration

**Using fossils**: Date of divergence from fossil record

- **Challenges**: Fossil may not be earliest, dating uncertainty
- **Best practices**: Multiple calibrations, account for uncertainty

**Geological events**: Vicariance events (e.g., Isthmus of Panama)

**Known historical events**: Human migrations, domestication events

### Relaxed Molecular Clocks

**Allow rate variation** among lineages

**Bayesian methods**: Incorporate rate variation in model

**Divergence time estimation**: BEAST, MCMCTree

### Applications

**Dating evolutionary events**: Origin of groups, biogeographic patterns

**Evolutionary rates**: Compare rates among lineages, genes

**Ancestral sequence reconstruction**

## Applications of Phylogenetics

**Phylogenetic classification**: Groups should be monophyletic

**Linnaean system vs. phylogenetic**: Rankless vs. ranked classifications
