## Introduction

Speciation—the process by which new species arise—represents the bridge between microevolution (changes within populations) and macroevolution (large-scale evolutionary patterns). This chapter explores how populations become reproductively isolated and diverge to form new species, and how these processes over geological time have produced the remarkable diversity of life on Earth. Understanding speciation is essential for comprehending biodiversity patterns, evolutionary history, and the current biodiversity crisis.

## What is a Species?

### The Species Problem

**Challenge**: No single definition works for all organisms

**Importance**: Species are fundamental units in evolution, ecology, and conservation

### Species Concepts

**Biological Species Concept (BSC)** (Ernst Mayr, 1942):

- **Definition**: Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups
- **Strengths**: Clear criteria, emphasizes reproductive isolation as key to divergence
- **Limitations**: Doesn't work for asexual organisms, fossils, or geographically separated populations
- **Problems**: Hybridization common in nature (∼10% of animal species, ∼25% of plants)

**Morphological Species Concept**:

- **Definition**: Species defined by differences in morphology
- **Strengths**: Practical, works for fossils and asexual organisms
- **Limitations**: Subjectivity, cryptic species, phenotypic plasticity

**Phylogenetic Species Concept**:

- **Definition**: Smallest monophyletic group on phylogenetic tree
- **Strengths**: Objective, works with molecular data
- **Limitations**: Depends on data and analysis methods, may recognize too many species

**Ecological Species Concept**:

- **Definition**: Species defined by ecological niche
- **Strengths**: Emphasizes adaptation and natural selection
- **Limitations**: Difficult to apply, niches can overlap

**Other concepts**: Recognition, cohesion, evolutionary

### Species in Practice

**Operational criteria**: Used by taxonomists

- **Genetic distance**: Typically >2% sequence divergence for sister species
- **Reproductive isolation**: In sympatry
- **Morphological distinction**: Statistically significant differences

**Cryptic species**: Morphologically similar but genetically distinct
**Ring species**: Chain of populations where adjacent populations interbreed but ends do not

## Reproductive Isolation

### Premating (Prezygotic) Barriers

**Prevent mating or fertilization**:

1. **Temporal isolation**: Breed at different times
   - *Example*: *Magicicada* cicadas (13 vs. 17 year cycles)

2. **Habitat isolation**: Occupy different habitats
   - *Example*: *Anolis* lizards on different parts of trees

3. **Behavioral isolation**: Different courtship behaviors
   - *Example*: Bird songs, firefly flash patterns

4. **Mechanical isolation**: Physical incompatibility
   - *Example*: Insect genitalia, flower structures

5. **Gametic isolation**: Gametes fail to unite
   - *Example*: Sea urchin sperm recognition proteins

### Postmating (Postzygotic) Barriers

**Reduce fitness of hybrid offspring**:

1. **Reduced hybrid viability**: Hybrids don't develop properly
   - *Example*: Frog hybrids die as tadpoles

2. **Reduced hybrid fertility**: Hybrids are sterile
   - *Example*: Mules (horse × donkey)

3. **Hybrid breakdown**: F2 or backcross hybrids have reduced fitness
   - *Example*: Cotton species hybrids

### Genetics of Reproductive Isolation

**Dobzhansky-Muller model**:

- **Problem**: How do incompatible alleles evolve without reducing fitness?
- **Solution**: Incompatibility requires interaction of alleles from different loci
- **Example**: Ancestral: A₁A₁B₁B₁
  Population 1: A₂A₂B₁B₁ (A₂ fixed)
  Population 2: A₁A₁B₂B₂ (B₂ fixed)
  Hybrid: A₂A₁B₂B₁ (incompatible if A₂ and B₂ don't work together)

**Haldane's rule**: When in the F1 offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic sex (XY or ZW)

**Speciation genes**: Genes involved in reproductive isolation
- Often related to gamete recognition, hybrid inviability, chromosomal rearrangements

## Modes of Speciation

### Allopatric Speciation

**Definition**: Speciation due to geographic isolation

**Most common mode**: Estimated >50% of speciation events

**Mechanisms**:

1. **Vicariance**: Physical barrier divides population
   - *Example*: Isthmus of Panama (∼3 million years ago)
   - **Evidence**: Sister species on either side (snapping shrimp, sea urchins)

2. **Peripatric speciation**: Small population isolated at edge of range
   - Similar to founder effect speciation
   - *Example*: Hawaiian Drosophila, island species

**Evidence**:

- Geographic concordance of sister species
- Ring species
- Experimental studies (Drosophila, sticklebacks)

### Sympatric Speciation

**Definition**: Speciation without geographic isolation

**Controversial**: Requires strong disruptive selection

**Mechanisms**:

1. **Disruptive selection + assortative mating**
   - *Example*: Apple maggot flies (Rhagoletis pomonella)
     - Original host: Hawthorn
     - New host: Apples (∼150 years ago)
     - Genetic differences: 6% allele frequency differences, different emergence times

2. **Polyploidy**: Instant speciation
   - **Autopolyploidy**: Within species (e.g., potato)
   - **Allopolyploidy**: Between species (e.g., wheat, cotton)
   - Common in plants (∼50% of angiosperms), rare in animals

3. **Host race formation**: Insects on different host plants
4. **Sexual selection**: Mate preference drives divergence

### Parapatric Speciation

**Definition**: Speciation with adjacent populations and limited gene flow

**Mechanism**: Selection gradient across environmental gradient

**Example**: *Anthoxanthum odoratum* (grass) on mine tailings (tolerant vs. non-tolerant)

### Quantum Speciation vs. Gradualism

**Phyletic gradualism**: Slow, steady change

**Punctuated equilibrium** (Eldredge and Gould, 1972):

- Most change occurs during speciation events
- Species relatively stable between speciation events
- **Evidence**: Fossil record shows stasis and sudden appearances

## Speciation Rates and Patterns

### Factors Influencing Speciation Rates

**Intrinsic factors**:

- **Generation time**: Faster in organisms with short generations
- **Dispersal ability**: Poor dispersers speciate faster (island biogeography)
- **Sexual selection**: Can accelerate speciation
- **Chromosomal rearrangements**: Can promote reproductive isolation

**Extrinsic factors**:

- **Geographic area**: Larger areas → more speciation
- **Climate change**: Creates/removes barriers
- **Ecological opportunity**: Adaptive radiation after extinction or colonization

### Adaptive Radiation

**Definition**: Rapid diversification from common ancestor into varied ecological niches

**Requirements**:

1. Common ancestry
2. Phenotype-environment correlation
3. Trait utility (adaptation)
4. Rapid speciation

**Classic examples**:

- **Darwin's finches**: Galápagos Islands (∼15 species)
- **Hawaiian honeycreepers**: ∼50 species from one colonization
- **Cichlid fishes**: African rift lakes (500+ species in Lake Victoria)
- **Anolis lizards**: Caribbean islands

**Triggers**:

- **Key innovations**: New traits allowing new niches
- **Colonization**: New area with available niches
- **Mass extinction**: Opens ecological space

### Island Biogeography Theory (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967)

**Principles**:

- **Island size**: Larger islands have more species
- **Distance from mainland**: Closer islands have more species
- **Equilibrium**: Immigration and extinction balance

**Application to speciation**: Islands as natural laboratories

## Macroevolutionary Patterns

### The Fossil Record

**Limitations**:

- Incomplete preservation
- Bias toward hard parts, common species, certain environments
- Temporal resolution limited

**Strengths**:

- Direct evidence of past life
- Temporal sequence
- Environmental context

**Dating methods**:

- **Relative dating**: Stratigraphy, index fossils
- **Absolute dating**: Radiometric (¹⁴C, K-Ar, U-Pb), paleomagnetism

### Patterns in the Fossil Record

**Biodiversity through time**:

- **Overall trend**: Increase in diversity (despite mass extinctions)
- **Rate of increase**: Higher in Phanerozoic than Precambrian
- **Current estimate**: ∼8.7 million eukaryotic species (only ∼1.5 million described)

**Evolutionary trends**:

- **Size increase**: Cope's rule (not universal)
- **Complexity increase**: Generally, but with reversals
- **Specialization**: Often leads to evolutionary "dead ends"

**Stasis**: Long periods of little change (support for punctuated equilibrium)

### Major Transitions in Evolution

1. **Origin of life**: ∼3.8 billion years ago
2. **Prokaryotic cells**: ∼3.5 billion years ago
3. **Photosynthesis**: ∼3.0 billion years ago (oxygen revolution)
4. **Eukaryotic cells**: ∼2.0 billion years ago (endosymbiosis)
5. **Multicellularity**: Animals ∼600 million years ago (Ediacaran)
6. **Cambrian explosion**: ∼541 million years ago (most animal phyla appear)
7. **Colonization of land**: Plants ∼470 million years ago, animals followed
8. **Evolution of flight**: Insects ∼400 million years ago, vertebrates later
9. **Human evolution**: Last 6-7 million years

### Convergent Evolution

**Definition**: Independent evolution of similar traits in unrelated lineages

**Examples**:

- **Flight**: Birds, bats, insects
- **Camera eyes**: Vertebrates, cephalopods
- **Streamlined body**: Dolphins, ichthyosaurs
- **C4 photosynthesis**: Evolved independently >60 times in plants

**Significance**: Demonstrates adaptation to similar environmental challenges

## Mass Extinctions

### The "Big Five" Mass Extinctions

1. **End-Ordovician** (∼444 million years ago):
   - **Loss**: ∼85% of marine species
   - **Cause**: Glaciation and sea level drop

2. **Late Devonian** (∼375 million years ago):
   - **Loss**: ∼75% of species
   - **Cause**: Possibly anoxic oceans, volcanic activity

3. **End-Permian** (∼252 million years ago):
   - **"Great Dying"**: ∼96% of marine species, 70% of terrestrial vertebrates
   - **Cause**: Siberian Traps volcanism, climate change, anoxia

4. **End-Triassic** (∼201 million years ago):
   - **Loss**: ∼80% of species
   - **Cause**: Central Atlantic Magmatic Province volcanism

5. **End-Cretaceous (K-Pg)** (66 million years ago):
   - **Loss**: ∼75% of species, including non-avian dinosaurs
   - **Cause**: Chicxulub asteroid impact + Deccan Traps volcanism

### Patterns and Consequences

**Selectivity**: Some groups more affected than others

**Recovery**: Takes 5-10 million years for diversity to recover

**Evolutionary consequences**:

- Opens ecological space for survivors
- Changes evolutionary trajectories
- **Example**: Mammal diversification after dinosaur extinction

### The Sixth Mass Extinction?

**Current rates**: 100-1000× background extinction rate

**Causes**: Habitat loss, climate change, pollution, overexploitation, invasive species

**Differences from past**: Human-caused, much faster

**Projections**: 20-50% of species could be extinct by 2100

## Evolutionary Trends and Contingency

### Trends vs. Progress

**Common misconceptions**:

- Evolution is progressive
- Humans are "highest" form
- Evolution has goals or direction

**Reality**:

- Evolution has no foresight or goals
- "Higher" and "lower" are value judgments
- Adaptation is local and current

### Contingency in Evolution

**Gould's thought experiment**: Replay life's tape

- Would evolution follow similar path?
- Unlikely to produce similar outcomes

**Evidence**: Convergent evolution shows some predictability, but details differ

**Historical contingency**: Past events constrain future possibilities

- **Example**: QWERTY keyboard, historical constraints in biology

### Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo)

**Key insights**:

- Similar genetic toolkit across animals
- Changes in gene regulation more important than new genes
- **Hox genes**: Control body plan development, conserved across animals

**Heterochrony**: Changes in timing of development

- **Paedomorphosis**: Retention of juvenile traits in adults
- **Peramorphosis**: Extended development

## Quantitative Problems

1. **Island Biogeography**:
   An island has an immigration rate I = 10 - 0.1S (where S = number of species) and an extinction rate E = 0.05S.
   a) What is the equilibrium number of species?
   b) If the island doubles in size, extinction rate becomes E = 0.025S. What is the new equilibrium?
   c) If distance increases, immigration becomes I = 5 - 0.1S. What is the new equilibrium?

2. **Speciation Rate Calculations**:
   A clade has 1000 extant species. Fossil evidence suggests the clade originated 50 million years ago.
   a) Assuming constant speciation rate and no extinction, what is the speciation rate (species per million years)?
   b) If extinction rate is 0.5 species/million years, what is the net diversification rate?
   c) How many species would be expected after 100 million years at this net rate?

3. **Genetic Divergence**:
   Two populations were separated 1 million years ago. Mutation rate is 10⁻⁸ per base per generation, generation time is 5 years.
   a) How many mutations are expected per base in each lineage?
   b) What is the expected sequence divergence between populations?
   c) If reproductive isolation typically occurs at 2% divergence, is speciation likely?
