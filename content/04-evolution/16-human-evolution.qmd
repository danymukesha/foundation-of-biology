## Introduction

Human evolution represents the story of our own species—where we came from, how we became what we are, and what makes us unique among primates. This chapter traces our evolutionary journey from early primates to modern humans, examining the fossil evidence, genetic data, and archaeological remains that tell this remarkable story. Understanding human evolution not only satisfies our curiosity about our origins but also provides insights into human biology, behavior, and health. It reminds us that we are part of the natural world, shaped by the same evolutionary processes that have shaped all life on Earth.

3. **Forward-facing eyes**: Stereoscopic vision, depth perception
4. **Large brains** relative to body size
5. **Extended parental care**: Long gestation, postnatal development
6. **Social complexity**: Varied social systems

**Evolutionary trends**:

- Reduction of snout

## Early Hominin Evolution

### Defining Hominins

**Hominins**: Humans and all ancestors after divergence from chimpanzee lineage

**Key adaptations**:

1. **Bipedalism**: Walking on two legs
2. **Tool use** (later)
3. **Brain expansion** (later)
4. **Language and culture** (much later)

### The First Hominins

**Sahelanthropus tchadensis** (∼7 million years ago):

  - **Discovery**: Ethiopia (1994)
  - **Features**: Both climbing and bipedal adaptations
  - **Environment**: Woodland, not savanna

### Australopithecines

**Time range**: ∼4.2-1.9 million years ago

**Key features**:

4. **"Robust" australopithecines** (Paranthropus): Massive jaws, sagittal crest
   - **P. boisei** (2.3-1.2 mya): "Nutcracker Man"

### Why Bipedalism?

**Advantages** (hypotheses):

1. **Energy efficiency**: More efficient for long-distance travel
2. **Heat stress**: Less surface area exposed to sun
3. **Carrying**: Free hands for tools/food
4. **Seeing over grass**: In savanna environment
5. **Display**: Sexual selection

**Evidence for arboreal heritage**:

- Curved fingers/toes

### Are Humans Still Evolving?

**Arguments for**:

- Selection still operates (e.g., age at first birth)
- Mutation still occurs
- Some traits changing (e.g., age at menarche, height)
- New selective pressures (e.g., diet, modern diseases)

**Arguments against**:

- Medical care reduces selection
- Birth control affects reproductive patterns
- Globalization increases gene flow
- Cultural evolution may dominate

**Probably yes**, but differently than in past

### Future Human Evolution

**Possible directions**:

- **Resistance**: To new diseases, environmental toxins
- **Adaptation**: To changing climate, new diets
- **Cognitive traits**: If correlated with reproductive success
- **Artificial selection**: Through genetic technologies

**Uncertainties**:

- Environmental changes
- Technological developments
- Social and cultural factors

3. **"Missing links"**: All fossils are transitional
4. **"Evolution is just a theory"**: Theory in scientific sense
5. **"If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"**: Branches, not linear progression

### Race and Human Variation

**Genetic variation**:

- **Within populations**: ∼85% of total human genetic variation
- **Between populations**: ∼15%
- **Between continents**: ∼10%

**Race as biological concept**:

- No clear genetic boundaries
- Continuous variation, not discrete categories
- More variation within than between "races"
- Social construction with biological consequences

### Evolutionary Psychology

**Study of**: Psychological adaptations

**Controversies**:

- **Just-so stories**: Unfalsifiable explanations
- **Genetic determinism**: Ignoring culture, plasticity
- **Adaptationism**: Assuming all traits are adaptations

**Valid insights**: Some universal human behaviors may have evolutionary basis

### Creationism and Intelligent Design

**Scientific response**:

- Evolution is well-supported by multiple lines of evidence
- No scientific controversy about fact of evolution
- Intelligent design not testable science

**Teaching evolution**:

- Important for scientific literacy
- Does not conflict with religious belief for many

## Quantitative Problems

1. **Genetic Divergence**:
   Humans and chimpanzees diverged ∼7 million years ago.
   Genetic divergence is ∼1.2%.
   a) What is the average rate of genetic divergence per million years?
   b) If mutation rate is constant, when did humans and Neanderthals diverge (∼0.1% difference)?
   c) What are the limitations of this calculation?

2. **Population Genetics**:
   Lactase persistence allele frequency in northern Europeans is ∼0.9.
   In the ancestral population (before dairy farming), it was ∼0.01.
   a) If selection coefficient s=0.1, how many generations to reach current frequency?
   b) If generation time is 25 years, how many years?
   c) Does this match archaeological evidence for dairying (∼8,000 years ago)?

3. **Fossil Dating**:
   A hominin fossil is found between two volcanic layers.
   Lower layer: 2.1 ± 0.1 million years (K-Ar dating)
   Upper layer: 1.9 ± 0.1 million years
   a) What is the age range of the fossil?
   b) If similar fossils are known from 2.0-1.8 mya elsewhere, is this consistent?
   c) How would additional dating methods improve precision?

## Case Study: The Hobbit - Homo floresiensis

**Background**: Discovered in 2003 on Flores Island, Indonesia, this 1-meter tall hominin with a 400 cc brain lived ∼100,000-50,000 years ago.

**Questions**:

1. What are the possible explanations for H. floresiensis (dwarfed H. erectus, separate lineage, diseased modern human)?
2. What evidence supports each hypothesis?
3. How does this discovery challenge traditional views of brain size and intelligence?
4. What does the coexistence with modern humans (until ∼50,000 years ago) suggest about human dispersal?

**Data for analysis**:

- Height: ∼1 m
- Brain size: ∼400 cc (chimp-sized)
- Tools: Stone tools associated
- Other fauna: Dwarf elephants, giant rats (island rule)
- Dating: 100,000-50,000 years ago
- Controversy: Some argue it's a modern human with pathology
