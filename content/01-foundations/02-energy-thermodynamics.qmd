## Introduction

All living systems, from single bacterial cells to complex ecosystems, must obey the fundamental laws of physics. Thermodynamics ~the study of energy transformations~ provides essential insights into how living systems obtain, transform, and utilize energy while maintaining organization in a universe that tends toward disorder. This chapter establishes the physical foundations that govern all biological energy transactions, explaining why organisms must constantly acquire energy and how they efficiently convert it into useful work.

## Energy: The Capacity for Work

**Energy** is defined as the capacity to do work or cause change. In biological systems, energy enables:

- Chemical synthesis (anabolism)
- Mechanical motion (muscle contraction, cell division)
- Active transport across membranes
- Information processing (nerve impulses, gene expression)

### Forms of Energy Relevant to Biology

**Kinetic Energy**: Energy of motion
- *Molecular motion*: Thermal energy (heat)
- *Cellular motion*: Cytoplasmic streaming, muscle contraction

**Potential Energy**: Stored energy based on position or structure
- *Chemical energy*: Energy stored in molecular bonds
- *Concentration gradients*: Differences across membranes
- *Electrical gradients*: Charge differences across membranes

**Energy Transformations in Living Systems**:
```
Solar Energy → Chemical Energy → Mechanical Energy → Heat
    ↓            ↓                ↓
Photosynthesis Metabolism        Movement
```

## The Laws of Thermodynamics

### First Law: Conservation of Energy

**Statement**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**Mathematical expression**: ΔE = Q - W
- ΔE: Change in internal energy of system
- Q: Heat added to system
- W: Work done by system

**Biological implications**:
1. Organisms cannot create energy; they must capture it from their environment
2. The total energy in any biological process remains constant
3. Energy transformations are never 100% efficient; some energy is always lost as heat

**Example**: In cellular respiration:
```
Chemical energy in glucose → Chemical energy in ATP + Heat
     686 kcal/mol              ~263 kcal/mol   ~423 kcal/mol
                    (approximately 38% efficiency)
```

### Second Law: The Entropy Principle

**Statement**: In any energy transformation, the total entropy of the universe increases.

**Entropy (S)**: A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.
- Ordered systems have low entropy
- Disordered systems have high entropy

**Mathematical expression**: ΔS<sub>universe</sub> = ΔS<sub>system</sub> + ΔS<sub>surroundings</sub> > 0

**Biological implications**:
1. Living systems create local order at the expense of increasing disorder elsewhere
2. Energy transformations are directional; they proceed spontaneously only toward increased total entropy
3. Maintaining biological organization requires continuous energy input

**The apparent paradox**: Living systems appear to defy the Second Law by becoming more ordered (developing complex structures). Resolution: Organisms are **open systems** that export entropy to their surroundings.

**Example**: A growing plant becomes more ordered (low entropy) by:
- Absorbing ordered sunlight
- Releasing disordered heat and waste products
- Increasing total entropy of the universe

## Gibbs Free Energy: Predicting Reaction Direction

The **Gibbs Free Energy (G)** combines enthalpy (heat content) and entropy to predict whether a reaction will occur spontaneously under constant temperature and pressure.

### The Gibbs Free Energy Equation

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Where:
- ΔG: Change in free energy (kJ/mol)
- ΔH: Change in enthalpy (heat content; kJ/mol)
- T: Absolute temperature (Kelvin)
- ΔS: Change in entropy (kJ/mol·K)

### Interpreting ΔG Values

**ΔG < 0 (Negative)**:

- Reaction is **exergonic** (energy-releasing)
- Occurs spontaneously
- Products have less free energy than reactants
- *Example: ATP hydrolysis: ΔG ≈ -30.5 kJ/mol*

**ΔG > 0 (Positive)**:

- Reaction is **endergonic** (energy-requiring)
- Does not occur spontaneously
- Requires energy input to proceed
- Products have more free energy than reactants
- *Example: Glucose synthesis: ΔG ≈ +686 kJ/mol*

**ΔG = 0**:

- System is at equilibrium
- No net change occurs
- Forward and reverse reactions proceed at equal rates

### Standard Free Energy Change (ΔG°′)

Biological standard conditions:

- Temperature: 25°C (298 K)
- Pressure: 1 atmosphere
- pH: 7.0
- Reactant concentrations: 1.0 M

**Important**: Actual ΔG in cells differs from ΔG°′ due to non-standard concentrations.

**Relationship to equilibrium constant (K<sub>eq</sub>)**:
ΔG°′ = -RT ln K<sub>eq</sub>

Where:

- R: Gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
- T: Temperature (K)
- K<sub>eq</sub>: [Products]/[Reactants] at equilibrium

## ATP: The Cellular Energy Currency

**Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)** serves as the primary energy carrier in all living cells.

### Structure of ATP

- **Adenine**: Nitrogenous base
- **Ribose**: Five-carbon sugar
- **Three phosphate groups**: High-energy bonds

### ATP Hydrolysis

ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O → ADP + P<sub>i</sub> + Energy
- ΔG°′ ≈ -30.5 kJ/mol
- Highly exergonic under cellular conditions

**Why ATP hydrolysis releases energy**:

1. **Charge repulsion**: Negative charges on phosphate groups repel each other
2. **Resonance stabilization**: Inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) is more stable than phosphate in ATP
3. **Increased entropy**: One molecule becomes two molecules

### ATP Cycle in Cells

```

    ↓        cellular work
    ↓            ↓
ATP ←──────────→ ADP + P_i
    Synthesis    Hydrolysis
```

**ATP turnover rate**: A typical mammalian cell hydrolyzes and resynthesizes its entire ATP pool every 1-2 minutes.

### Other Energy Carriers

**Electron Carriers**:

- **NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH**: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
- **FAD/FADH<sub>2</sub>**: Flavin adenine dinucleotide
- **NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH**: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate

**Activated Carriers**:

- **Acetyl-CoA**: Activated acetate
- **UTP, GTP, CTP**: Nucleotide triphosphates for specific syntheses

## Metabolic Pathways: Energy Flow in Cells

**Metabolism**: The sum of all chemical reactions in an organism.

### Catabolic Pathways

Break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy.

**Examples**:

1. **Glycolysis**: Glucose → Pyruvate (net: 2 ATP + 2 NADH)
2. **Citric Acid Cycle**: Acetyl-CoA → CO<sub>2</sub> (net: 1 ATP + 3 NADH + 1 FADH<sub>2</sub> per acetyl-CoA)
3. **Oxidative Phosphorylation**: NADH/FADH<sub>2</sub> oxidation → ATP (major ATP source)

**Energy yields** (complete glucose oxidation):

- Theoretical maximum: 36-38 ATP
- Actual in cells: ~30 ATP (due to energy costs of transport, etc.)

### Anabolic Pathways

Synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy input.

**Examples**:

1. **Gluconeogenesis**: Synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors
2. **Protein Synthesis**: Amino acids → Polypeptides
3. **Lipid Synthesis**: Acetyl-CoA → Fatty acids

### Regulation of Metabolic Pathways

**Feedback Inhibition**: End product inhibits early enzyme in pathway
*Example: ATP inhibits phosphofructokinase in glycolysis*

**Allosteric Regulation**: Binding at sites other than active site modifies enzyme activity

**Covalent Modification**: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activates/deactivates enzymes

**Compartmentalization**: Separating opposing pathways in different cellular locations

**Chemotrophs**: Obtain energy from chemical compounds
- *Chemoautotrophs*: Use inorganic compounds (H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>)
- *Chemoheterotrophs*: Use organic compounds (animals, fungi, most bacteria)

### Classification by Carbon Source

**Autotrophs**: "Self-feeders"; synthesize organic compounds from inorganic carbon (CO<sub>2</sub>)
- *Examples*: Plants, algae, some bacteria

**Heterotrophs**: "Other-feeders"; obtain organic compounds from other organisms
- *Examples*: Animals, fungi, most bacteria

### Metabolic Efficiency Comparisons

**Photosynthetic efficiency**:

- Theoretical maximum: 11-12% of solar energy
- Typical plants: 3-6%
- Reasons for inefficiency: Light absorption limits, photorespiration, metabolic costs

- Explains why food chains are typically limited to 4-5 levels
- Most energy is lost as heat at each transfer

**Biomass Pyramid**: Usually similar shape to energy pyramid
**Numbers Pyramid**: Shape varies depending on organism size

### Human Impact on Energy Flows

**Agriculture**: Redirects energy flow to human consumption
- Only ~10% of plant biomass becomes human food in grain-fed meat production

**Fossil Fuels**: Ancient stored photosynthetic energy
- Formed over millions of years, consumed in centuries

**Renewable Energy**: Attempts to harness current photosynthetic output
- Biofuels from crops, algae, or waste
