## Introduction

Bioinformatics and computational biology represent the fusion of biology with computer science, statistics, and mathematics. As biological research generates ever-increasing volumes of data—from DNA sequences to protein structures to ecological observations—computational methods have become essential for storing, analyzing, and interpreting this information. These fields transform raw data into biological insight, enabling discoveries that would be impossible through traditional laboratory methods alone. From identifying disease genes to understanding evolutionary relationships to predicting protein functions, computational approaches have become integral to virtually all areas of modern biology.
