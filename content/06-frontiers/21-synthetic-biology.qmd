## Introduction

Synthetic biology represents a fundamental shift in how we approach living systems. Rather than simply studying biology as it exists, synthetic biology applies engineering principles to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to redesign existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. This emerging field sits at the intersection of biology, engineering, computer science, and chemistry, creating tools to program living cells much as we program computers. From producing life-saving medicines to cleaning up environmental pollutants, synthetic biology promises to revolutionize how we interact with the biological world.

## Foundations of Synthetic Biology

### Definition and Scope

**Synthetic biology**: The design and construction of new biological entities or systems, and the redesign of existing biological systems, for useful purposes.

**Key distinctions from genetic engineering**:

- **Scale**: Genetic engineering typically modifies single genes; synthetic biology often engineers entire pathways or genomes
- **Approach**: Genetic engineering is often ad hoc; synthetic biology applies systematic engineering principles
- **Goals**: Genetic engineering aims to modify existing traits; synthetic biology aims to create novel functions
- **Standardization**: Synthetic biology emphasizes standardized parts and assembly methods

### Core Principles

1. **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity through well-defined interfaces
2. **Standardization**: Creating interchangeable biological parts
3. **Modularity**: Designing systems from functional modules
4. **Characterization**: Quantifying part performance under different conditions
5. **Decoupling**: Separating design from fabrication

### Engineering Paradigms

**Top-down approach**: Simplifying existing biological systems (minimal genomes)

**Bottom-up approach**: Constructing synthetic systems from basic components (protocells)

**Middle-out approach**: Combining natural and synthetic components

## Quantitative Problems

1. **Genetic Circuit Modeling**:
   Consider a simple toggle switch with two repressors A and B.
   - Production rate of A = α₁/(1 + [B]ⁿ) - δ₁[A]
   - Production rate of B = α₂/(1 + [A]ⁿ) - δ₂[B]
   Where α₁ = α₂ = 10, δ₁ = δ₂ = 1, n = 2 (Hill coefficient)
   a) Solve for steady states ([A], [B]) where d[A]/dt = d[B]/dt = 0
   b) Plot the nullclines and identify stable states
   c) How does changing α₁ to 15 affect the system?

2. **Metabolic Burden Calculation**:
   A synthetic pathway adds 5 proteins to a cell, each 300 amino acids.
   Transcription/translation costs: ~4 ATP per amino acid
   Protein degradation: ~0.1 per hour per protein
   Cell division: Every 30 minutes
   a) Calculate ATP cost per cell cycle for the pathway
   b) If cell has 10⁸ ATP per cycle for protein synthesis, what fraction is used?
   c) How might this burden affect growth rate?

3. **Containment Probability**:
   An engineered bacterium has:
   - Probability of escape from fermenter: 10⁻⁶ per day
   - Probability of survival in environment: 10⁻⁴
   - Probability of horizontal gene transfer: 10⁻⁷ per encounter
   - Wild type encounter rate: 10⁴ per day in environment
   a) What's the probability of gene transfer per day of operation?
   b) If operated for 100 days, what's the overall probability?
   c) How do these probabilities change with additional containment strategies?
