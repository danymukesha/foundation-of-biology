## Final Reflection: Biology in the Anthropocene

We live in the Anthropocene—an epoch in which human activity is the dominant influence on climate and the environment. Biology, which once primarily studied nature as we found it, now increasingly shapes nature through our interventions. This gives biologists extraordinary power and corresponding responsibility.

As you continue your journey in biology—whether as a researcher, healthcare professional, educator, policymaker, or informed citizen—consider:

- **What future do you want biology to help create?**
- **What values should guide biological innovation?**
- **How can biology contribute to a flourishing world for all life?**
- **What is your role in shaping the future of biology?**

The frontiers of biology are not just places of scientific discovery, but crossroads where science meets society, technology meets ethics, and human ingenuity meets planetary limits. How we navigate these frontiers will help determine what kind of future emerges from our biological century.
