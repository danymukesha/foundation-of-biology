## Introduction

Genomics represents a paradigm shift in biology—from studying individual genes to analyzing entire genomes. This chapter explores how modern technologies enable us to sequence, assemble, and interpret genomes, transforming our understanding of biology, medicine, and evolution. We will examine how genomic approaches build upon classical and molecular genetics, providing comprehensive views of genetic information and its expression. As we enter the post-genomic era, we face both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges in interpreting and applying genomic knowledge.
