## Introduction

Gene expression must be precisely regulated to ensure that the right genes are expressed at the right time, in the right cells, and in the right amounts. This chapter explores the sophisticated mechanisms that cells use to control gene expression, from transcriptional initiation to protein degradation. We will examine how regulatory systems implement the information processing principles introduced earlier, enabling cells to respond to signals, differentiate into specialized types, and maintain homeostasis. Understanding gene regulation is key to comprehending development, cellular adaptation, and diseases like cancer.

## Principles of Gene Regulation

### Why Regulate Gene Expression?

**Cellular economy**: Protein synthesis is energetically expensive

- **Cost**: ~4 ATP equivalents per peptide bond
- **Strategy**: Express genes only when needed

**Cellular differentiation**: Different cell types express different genes

- **Example**: Hemoglobin in red blood cells, insulin in pancreatic β-cells

**Environmental response**: Adapt to changing conditions
- **Examples**: Heat shock response, nutrient availability

**Development**: Temporal and spatial control of gene expression

### Levels of Regulation

1. **Transcriptional**: Control of when and how often gene is transcribed
2. **Post-transcriptional**: RNA processing, stability, localization
3. **Translational**: Control of translation initiation and efficiency
4. **Post-translational**: Protein modification, localization, degradation

**Prokaryotes**: Mainly transcriptional regulation

**Eukaryotes**: Regulation at all levels, with greater complexity

### Regulatory Elements

**cis-acting elements**: DNA sequences affecting nearby genes

- **Promoters**: Initiate transcription
- **Enhancers**: Increase transcription (can be distant)
- **Silencers**: Decrease transcription
- **Insulators**: Block enhancer-promoter interactions

**trans-acting factors**: Proteins that bind regulatory elements

- **Transcription factors**: Bind DNA, regulate transcription
- **Coactivators/repressors**: Don't bind DNA directly, modulate transcription

## Prokaryotic Gene Regulation

### The Operon Model

**Operon**: Cluster of genes with related functions transcribed as single mRNA

**Components**:

- **Structural genes**: Code for enzymes
- **Promoter**: RNA polymerase binding site
- **Operator**: Repressor binding site
- **Regulatory gene**: Codes for repressor (often elsewhere)

### Lac Operon (Inducible System)

**Function**: Lactose metabolism

**Genes**: lacZ (β-galactosidase), lacY (permease), lacA (transacetylase)

**Regulation**:

- **Lactose absent**: Repressor bound to operator, no transcription
- **Lactose present**: Allolactose binds repressor, inactivates it, transcription occurs
- **Glucose effect**: Catabolite repression via cAMP-CAP complex

**Dual control**:

1. **Negative control**: Repressor prevents transcription
2. **Positive control**: CAP activates transcription when glucose low

### Trp Operon (Repressible System)

**Function**: Tryptophan synthesis

**Regulation**:

- **Tryptophan absent**: Repressor inactive, transcription occurs
- **Tryptophan present**: Tryptophan binds repressor (corepressor), activates it, transcription blocked

**Attenuation**: Additional regulation via leader peptide and transcription termination

- **High trp**: Ribosome moves quickly, termination structure forms
- **Low trp**: Ribosome stalls, antitermination structure forms

### Two-Component Systems

**Common in**: Bacteria, archaea, plants, fungi

**Components**:

1. **Sensor kinase**: Membrane protein, autophosphorylates when signal detected
2. **Response regulator**: Receives phosphate, activates transcription

**Example**: Chemotaxis in E. coli

## Eukaryotic Transcriptional Regulation

### Complexity of Eukaryotic Regulation

**Challenges**:

1. DNA packaged in chromatin
2. Nucleus separates transcription and translation
3. Larger genomes with more genes
4. Multicellularity requires cell-type specific expression

### Chromatin Structure and Regulation

**Nucleosomes**: DNA wrapped around histone octamers

- **Core histones**: H2A, H2B, H3, H4 (2 each)
- **Linker histone**: H1

**Chromatin remodeling complexes**: Use ATP to slide, evict, or restructure nucleosomes

- **Examples**: SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD families

**Histone modifications**: Chemical groups added to histone tails

- **Acetylation**: Generally activates transcription (neutralizes positive charge)
- **Methylation**: Can activate or repress depending on position
- **Phosphorylation**: Often activates
- **Ubiquitination**: Variable effects

**Histone code hypothesis**: Combinations of modifications specify chromatin states

### DNA Methylation

**Occurs at**: CpG dinucleotides (cytosine followed by guanine)

**Enzyme**: DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)

**Effect**: Generally represses transcription

- **Patterns**: Tissue-specific, developmental regulation

**Genomic imprinting**: Parent-specific gene expression via differential methylation
**X-inactivation**: One X chromosome silenced in female mammals

### Transcription Factors

**Combinatorial control**: Combinations of factors determine expression

### Enhancers and Promoters

**Enhancers**:

- Can be upstream, downstream, or within genes
- Can be far from promoter (50+ kb)
- Looping brings enhancer to promoter
- **Mediator complex**: Bridges transcription factors and Pol II

**Promoter-proximal elements**: Near transcription start site

- **TATA box**: ~-30 in many genes
- **CAAT box**: ~-80
- **GC box**: ~-100

### RNA Polymerases and Their Regulation

**RNA Pol I**: rRNA genes (except 5S)

### RNA Localization

**Localized translation**: mRNA transported to specific cellular locations

**Mechanisms**: Motor proteins, localization sequences in 3' UTR

### Translational Regulation

**Initiation control**:

- **eIF2 phosphorylation**: Inhibits general translation (stress response)
- **eIF4E availability**: Rate-limiting for cap-dependent translation
- **IRES elements**: Internal ribosome entry sites (cap-independent)

## Quantitative Problems

1. **Operon Regulation**:
   In E. coli, the lac operon has a basal transcription rate of 1 unit. With CAP activated (glucose low), rate increases 50-fold. With repressor removed (lactose present), rate increases another 10-fold.
   a) Calculate transcription rate under: (i) glucose high, lactose absent; (ii) glucose high, lactose present; (iii) glucose low, lactose present.
   b) If a mutation reduces CAP binding 10-fold, what are the new rates?

2. **miRNA Regulation**:
   A miRNA reduces target mRNA stability. Normally, mRNA half-life is 4 hours. With miRNA, it becomes 1 hour.
   a) What is the steady-state mRNA level with miRNA relative to without?
   b) If translation rate is proportional to mRNA level, what is the effect on protein production?
   c) If miRNA also reduces translation efficiency by 50%, what is the total effect?

3. **Epigenetic Inheritance**:
   DNA methylation is maintained with 95% fidelity per cell division.
   a) After 10 cell divisions, what percentage of methylation marks remain?
   b) If a stem cell divides 100 times during a lifetime, what percentage remains?
   c) How does this explain epigenetic stability over many cell divisions?
