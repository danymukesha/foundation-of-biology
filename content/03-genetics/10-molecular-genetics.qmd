## Introduction

Molecular genetics bridges classical genetics with biochemistry, providing a physical and chemical understanding of heredity. This chapter explores the molecular basis of genetic phenomena, from the structure of DNA to the mechanisms of mutation and repair. We will examine how genetic information is encoded in DNA molecules, how this information can change through mutation, and how cells maintain genomic integrity. Understanding molecular genetics provides the foundation for modern biotechnology, genetic engineering, and personalized medicine.

## The Genetic Material

### Historical Background

**Early 20th century**: Chromosomes known to carry genetic information, but composition debated 

**Candidates**: Proteins (complex, diverse) vs. nucleic acids (simple, repetitive)

### Griffith's Transformation Experiment (1928)

**Organism**: Streptococcus pneumoniae

**Strains**: Smooth (virulent, encapsulated) and rough (avirulent, unencapsulated)

**Key experiment**: Heat-killed smooth + live rough → live smooth

**Conclusion**: "Transforming principle" from dead cells could change living cells

### Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944)

**Question**: What is the transforming principle?

**Approach**: Purify components from smooth bacteria, test transformation

**Treatments**: Proteases (destroy proteins), RNase (destroy RNA), DNase (destroy DNA)

**Result**: Only DNase destroyed transforming activity

**Conclusion**: DNA is the transforming principle (genetic material)

### Hershey-Chase Experiment (1952)

**Organism**: Bacteriophage T2 (infects E. coli)

**Labeling**: ³²P (DNA) vs. ³⁵S (protein)

**Experiment**: Infect bacteria, blend to remove phage coats, centrifuge

**Result**: ³²P (DNA) inside bacteria, ³⁵S (protein) outside

**Conclusion**: DNA enters bacteria, directs phage reproduction (DNA is genetic material)

### Chargaff's Rules (1950)

**Observations**:

1. DNA composition varies between species
2. Within species: A = T, G = C (A+T ≠ G+C)

**Significance**: Provided clues to DNA structure

### Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins (1953)

**X-ray diffraction**: Rosalind Franklin's Photo 51 showed helical structure

**Model building**: Watson and Crick proposed double helix

**Key features**: Complementary base pairing, antiparallel strands, right-handed helix

## DNA Replication (Detailed)

### Semiconservative Replication

**Meselson-Stahl Experiment (1958)**:

- **Method**: Density gradient centrifugation with ¹⁵N (heavy) and ¹⁴N (light)

## Mutations

### Types of Mutations

**Point mutations** (single base changes):

- **Transition**: Purine to purine (A↔G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (C↔T)
- **Transversion**: Purine to pyrimidine or vice versa

**Functional consequences**:

- **Silent mutation**: Same amino acid (synonymous)
- **Missense mutation**: Different amino acid

  - Conservative: Similar properties
  - Non-conservative: Different properties
  
- **Nonsense mutation**: Stop codon created
- **Frameshift mutation**: Insertion/deletion not multiple of 3

**Chromosomal mutations**:

- **Deletion**: Loss of segment
- **Duplication**: Repeat of segment
- **Inversion**: Segment reversed
- **Translocation**: Segment moved to different chromosome

### Causes of Mutations

**Spontaneous**:

- **Replication errors**: Polymerase mistakes
- **Tautomeric shifts**: Rare base forms mispair
- **Depurination**: Loss of purine base (~10,000/cell/day)

**Induced**:

- **Chemical mutagens**:

  - Base analogs: 5-bromouracil (T analog)
  - Alkylating agents: EMS, adds alkyl groups
  - Intercalating agents: Ethidium bromide, between bases
  
- **Radiation**:

  - UV light: Pyrimidine dimers (TT, CT, CC)
  - Ionizing radiation: Single- and double-strand breaks

### Mutation Rates

**Variation across organisms**:

- RNA viruses: 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁵ per base per replication
- DNA viruses: 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸
- Bacteria: ~10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹⁰
- Eukaryotes: ~10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹¹

### Base Excision Repair (BER)

**For**: Small, non-helix-distorting base lesions

**Steps**:

1. DNA glycosylase removes damaged base
2. AP endonuclease nicks backbone
3. DNA polymerase fills gap
4. DNA ligase seals nick

**Examples**: Uracil (from deaminated cytosine), oxidized bases

- **Transcription-coupled NER**: Active genes

**Diseases**: Xeroderma pigmentosum (NER defect → skin cancer)

### Mismatch Repair (MMR)

**For**: Replication errors (base mismatches, small insertions/deletions)

**Recognition**: MutS protein binds mismatch

**Key feature**: Distinguishes template strand from new strand (methylation in bacteria, nicks in eukaryotes)

**Disease**: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome)

### Double-Strand Break Repair

**Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)**:

- **Repetitive DNA**: Tandem repeats, transposable elements
- **Pseudogenes**: Non-functional copies of genes

### Genome Size Paradox (C-value paradox)

**Observation**: Genome size doesn't correlate with organismal complexity

**Examples**:

- Human: 3.2 Gb
- Lungfish: 130 Gb
- Paris japonica (plant): 150 Gb

**Explanation**: Non-coding DNA varies widely

## Genotype to Phenotype

### Biochemical Pathways

**One gene-one enzyme hypothesis** (Beadle and Tatum, 1941):

- Each gene encodes one enzyme
- Modified to: One gene-one polypeptide

**Metabolic pathways**: Mutations block steps

**Example**: Phenylketonuria (PKU)

- Gene: Phenylalanine hydroxylase
- Block: Phenylalanine → tyrosine
- Result: Phenylalanine accumulation, mental retardation

### Protein Structure and Function

**Sickle cell anemia**:

- Mutation: β-globin Glu6Val
- Effect: Hydrophobic patch causes polymerization
- Phenotype: Sickled cells, anemia, pain crises

**CFTR in cystic fibrosis**:

- Mutation: ΔF508 (deletion of phenylalanine)
- Effect: Misfolding, defective chloride channel
- Phenotype: Thick mucus, lung infections

### Genetic Heterogeneity

**Locus heterogeneity**: Mutations in different genes cause same phenotype

**Example**: Retinitis pigmentosa (mutations in >60 genes)

**Allelic heterogeneity**: Different mutations in same gene cause same phenotype

**Example**: Cystic fibrosis (>2000 CFTR mutations)

### Penetrance and Expressivity

**Penetrance**: Proportion of individuals with genotype who show phenotype

- **Complete**: All show phenotype
- **Incomplete**: Some show phenotype

**Expressivity**: Degree of phenotype expression

**Example**: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (variable expression)
